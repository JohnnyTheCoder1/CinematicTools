## Alien: Isolation Cinematic Tools

This is a continuation of the Alien: Isolation Cinematic Tools by [Hattiwatti](https://github.com/Hattiwatti), with the intention of adding extra useful features for modding the game.

### How to build

The project must be built in release mode, for x86 systems. This is the default project configuration.

Use Visual Studio VC 140 to compile, and make sure to have restored all Nuget packages.

### How to use

To hook the cinematic tools into Alien: Isolation, run the game, and then launch "inject.bat" in the root of the project.

This utilises [Injector](https://github.com/nefarius/Injector) - a project by [Benjamin HÃ¶glinger](https://github.com/nefarius) (thanks!).
